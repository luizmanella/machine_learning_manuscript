<h3>Summary:</h3>
<p>The goal of this repo is to go along with my personal learning. I am working on what I call a machine learning manuscript, although it feels
more like a desk manual. This manuscript is a document breaking down all the machine learning models I encounter as I learn about the various
models that currently exist. By no means will it include everything since the world of machine learning is absolutely gigantic. More importantly,
this manuscript will also be a heavily condensed version of material since its main purpose will be as a quick reference book rather than a 
pedagogical excerpt. As I go along my learning journey I will be coding along either projects, or functions themselves, that can be used. I will,
on occasion, try and code things from scratch, but only if time permits me to do so. I would like to cover a lot of, what I call, base machine 
learning topics through out this journey. I am working on more complex projects too that will be posted separately if and when I have the time.</p>
